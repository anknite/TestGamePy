Simple python tests with some programs.

1 "translate_user_input.py" will take in user input and translate the contents and print on console.
2 "translate_file.py "will take in file name as input and create a new file with translated contents.
3 "game_on.py" is a small python command line interactive game.


Note: To run the scripts you need to keep in mind the following things:
. Need running Python installation.
. Put file to be translated in the same directory as the scripts.[for easy understanding the script is written that way]
